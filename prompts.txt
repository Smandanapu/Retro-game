 🛠️ Starter Prompt: Create the Basic Game

Create a simple Kaboom.js platformer game with:
- A player that can move left, right, and jump
- A solid ground
- Gravity
- Simple keyboard controls
Use HTML and JavaScript in a single file (no build tools).

🧍‍♂️ Add Player Logic

In Kaboom.js, add a player that is a red square. The player should fall due to gravity and jump when pressing the spacebar.

🪙 Add Coins

Add coins to the Kaboom.js game that the player can collect. When collected, the coin should disappear and increase a score counter on the screen.

👾 Add Enemies

Add an enemy that moves back and forth on a platform. If the player touches it, show a "Game Over" screen.

🌆 Add Background and Levels

Add a scrolling background and allow level transitions when the player reaches the right edge of the screen.
