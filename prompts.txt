  High-Level Plan
Phase 1: Learn the Basics
Before using Amazon Q effectively, you'll need some foundational knowledge.

Understand What Tools You'll Use:

HTML: Structure of the webpage (where your game will live).

CSS: Styles to make it look good.

JavaScript: Logic of the game (movement, jumping, scoring).

Amazon Q: AI assistant inside IDEs like AWS Cloud9 or VS Code that can write code for you.

Game Framework: We’ll use Phaser.js, a beginner-friendly game engine for browser games.

Set Up a Workspace:

You can use AWS Cloud9 (free tier eligible) to code in the cloud, or use VS Code locally.

Amazon Q works inside both with the correct plugin.

🛠️ Phase 2: Create a Starter Game with Amazon Q
Ask Amazon Q to Create a Phaser.js Starter Project:

"Create a Phaser 3 starter template with a player that can move left, right, and jump on platforms."

Review the Code with Amazon Q:

Ask: “Can you explain what this code does?”

You’ll learn by reading Q’s explanations in plain English.

Run Your Game in the Browser:

Amazon Q will help set up a local web server or guide you to preview it.

You can hit "Run" in Cloud9 or open index.html in your browser.

🎨 Phase 3: Customize Your Game
With Q’s help, you can:

Replace the player sprite with Mario-style graphics.

Add enemies (like Goombas).

Add coins, scoring, and levels.

Add a start and game-over screen.

Example prompt to Q:

“Add an enemy that moves left and right on a platform and damages the player if touched.”

🌐 Phase 4: Host It Online
When your game is ready:

Use Amazon S3 + CloudFront to host the game as a static website.

Amazon Q can guide you through the deployment process.

📘 What You Should Learn (Minimal Coding Knowledge)
What is HTML/CSS/JS – Just a very basic understanding.

How to talk to Amazon Q effectively – Treat it like a teammate:

Be specific: “Add a jump animation when the player jumps.”

Ask for explanations: “What does this function do?”

How to preview/run code – You’ll learn this as we go.
